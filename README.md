# 🎸 Band Name Generator (Python)

A simple Python program that generates a fun band name based on user input.

## 🚀 How it works

The program asks the user two questions:

* The name of the city they grew up in
* The name of their pet

It then combines both inputs to create a unique band name.

---

## 🧠 Example

**Input:**

```
What is the name of the city you grew up in? Delhi
What is your pet's name? Bruno
```

**Output:**

```
Your band name could be: Delhi Bruno
```
